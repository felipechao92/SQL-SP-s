Overview
The ea.Rollback_Table stored procedure is designed to restore data from a backup table to the main table in SQL Server. This procedure is particularly useful for reverting changes made to a table by restoring its previous state from the backup.

Features
Truncates the main table and refills it with data from the backup table.
Handles identity columns intelligently, ensuring that identity insert settings are managed correctly.
Provides error handling to capture and raise errors during the rollback process.
Parameters
@backup_schema NVARCHAR(255): The schema of the backup table.
@backup_table_name NVARCHAR(255): The name of the backup table.
@main_schema NVARCHAR(255): The schema of the main table to be restored.
@main_table NVARCHAR(255): The name of the main table to be restored.
Behavior
Truncates the main table to prepare for data restoration.
Checks if the main table has an identity column and sets a flag accordingly.
If the main table has an identity column, it enables identity insert and then inserts data from the backup table. Otherwise, it simply inserts data from the backup table.
If identity insert was enabled, it is turned off after data insertion.
In case of an error during the process, captures the error details and raises an error with the information.
